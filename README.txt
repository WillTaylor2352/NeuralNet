Hello world, my name is Will Taylor. 

If you would like to edit my code, I do not mind. Do not push changes. If you have any changes you would like to 
have added in, code them yourself and send them as a zipped file to me. I would be glad to take a look at it and 
decide what will be added in. (I notate my code well and your contributions -if any- will be notated.)

I'd appreciate the help for sure, so if you are interested in becoming a regular contributor, e-mail me at: willtaylorofficial@yahoo.com

The purpose of this project: Develop a lightweight general purpose AI. 

The reason: In a world constantly changing at an unprecedented rate, we need to have systems such as these to 
perform actions and computations at an accelerated rate. This is ever-increasing. We need to develop these 
systems to benefit out current rate of growth.
